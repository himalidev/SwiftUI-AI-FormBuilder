# 🧠 SwiftUI-AI-FormBuilder

Generate dynamic SwiftUI forms from a simple text prompt using OpenAI's GPT API.

This project shows how to:
- Use natural language to define UI layouts (e.g., "a registration form with name, email, and password")
- Fetch and decode JSON-based form structures from OpenAI
- Dynamically render SwiftUI views using `ViewLayout` and `ViewElement` models
- Bind user input to a generic state model
- Handle form actions like "register" or "submit"

## 🧪 Features

- ✅ AI-generated UI layouts using GPT-4 or GPT-4o
- 🎨 Dynamic rendering with `DynamicFormView`
- 🔄 Live input binding using dictionary-backed `@State`
- 🔘 Form action handling (e.g., login, register)
- 🔐 Secure API key management via `.env`
